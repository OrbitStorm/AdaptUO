AdaptUO
=======

AdaptUO will no longer be supporting or sponsoring an official emulation package. Instead, we will be releasing custom content designed to function with the latest copies of RunUO and ServUO. If you're looking for a copy of the RunUO or ServUO software, please see the links below:

RunUO: http://runuo.com

ServUO: http://servuo.com

Content provided via this repository is provided as-is and will be updated as time permits. A wide variety of content will be available, such as simple unique items or extensive systems. A readme may not be provided with every file, so I strongly recommend reviewing the file before downloading and attempting to use it without being aware of its functionality.

Any content not containing a source or credit tag in the file header would indicate that the file was developed by myself. Any file that does contain a header is a revamp either for bug fixes or compatibility and I take absolutely no credit, implied or otherwise, for such content.

Any file residing in the initial root structure is considered standalone. Anything that require distro/core edits will be packaged in its own folder.
